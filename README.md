# Python Learning Project

This repository contains a collection of simple Python scripts created as part of a learning journey in Python programming.

## 📚 Contents

- `fix_me.py` – Function to calculate the average of a list of numbers

Each class represents a geometric figure and supports:

  - `get_area()` → implemented as a `@property` named `area`
  - `get_perimeter()` → implemented as a `@property` named `perimeter`
  - `add_area(figure)` → returns the sum of the areas of two figures

- More scripts coming soon as learning progresses...
